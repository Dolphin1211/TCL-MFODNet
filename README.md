# SAC-VGNet

The datasets for the paper 'Semantic Aligned Cross-Modal Visual Grounding Network with Transformer'



## Data preparation

We manually annotate a text description for each image in two fine-grained object detection datasets ( ["Military Aircraft Dataset"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/a2015003713/militaryaircraftdetectiondataset) and ["FGVC Aircraft Dataset"](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/fgvc-aircraft/) ), which could be downloaded in the [GDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16ytvHtQ3jUeJaK78Uv1bYGXs8NPXWCPZ?usp=share_link).
