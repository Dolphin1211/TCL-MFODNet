# TCL-MFODNet

The code for the paper 'Multi-modal Fine-grained Object Detection Network with Text-driven Contrastive Learning'

Code will be released soon.


## Data preparation

We manually annotate a text description for each image in two fine-grained object detection datasets ( ["Military Aircraft Dataset"](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/fgvc-aircraft/) and ["FGVC Aircraft Dataset"](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/fgvc-aircraft/) ), which could be downloaded in the [Gdrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16ytvHtQ3jUeJaK78Uv1bYGXs8NPXWCPZ?usp=share_link)
